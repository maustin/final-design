NAV SECTION
This will remain throughout the site, excepting maybe the 'processing' page.
Section should contain a logo, Home button (maybe this is just clicking on the logo), Login/Log Out button, Register/Profile button, cart button, browse button.

HOME
Displays maybe larger logo and "Deal of the Day". (Should "light"/"dark" theme be a switch here, or something in the browse section?)

LOGIN
Either modal or page. Email and password inputs, submit button. Also a forgot password link.

REGISTER
Username, email, password 1, password 2, homeworld inputs, submit button.

FORGOT PASSWORD
* Very low priority. Email and submit button. (Working in outgoing email is a pretty large undertaking.)

PROFILE
Display user's name and email. Maybe include a past purchases section?
Additional buttons to update user's name, email, password, or homeworld.

BROWSE
Displays all ships. Has a Filter section to narrow down results. Also Sort section.
Clicking on a ship brings up ship details section. Each ship item will display a short summary
of the item: Image, name, class, new/used, Empire/Rebel/neutral, price, and possible 'special' tag.
Filter contains:
By name, by model, by class, cost sliders (min, max), new/used, Empire/Rebellion/neutral,
atmosphere capable. (maybe that's more than enough)
Sort by:
Name, cost, cargo capacity, hyperdrive rating (if including the rating, should maybe show on the item summary)

DETAILS
Ship details page will contain large image and full specs:
Name, model, class, new/used, price, manufacturers, length (m), atmosphere capable, atmosphere speed, crew, passenders, cargo capacity, max resupply length (days, weeks, months, years), MGLT (megalights), hyperdrive rating.
There will be a Add to Cart button and possibly a Quantity selector. (Selector should only show as many ships are in stock, up to like 10.)

CART
The cart displays the items currently in the cart. These items will either be a single line with New/Used status, name, price, quantity. (Yes for quantity?) Also 'Remove' button.
There will be a subtotal section and a Checkout button.

CHECKOUT
Checkout page will show price breakdown section (ships + tax + delivery fee?).
There will be a payment entry section. I think a couple 'fun' payment methods, like: Imperial Credits Card, Rebelbucks, Darkcoin, Jedimo, and something silly like... ?
There should be form validation for all fields. This will prob be simple feedback below each field.
Finally, a complete purchase button. Pressing the complete button, either go to a "processing" page or show a modal over the checkout page. On processing complete, go to purchase complete page.

PURCHASE COMPLETE
Cart is emptied, items quantities removed from DB. Show a thanks message.
